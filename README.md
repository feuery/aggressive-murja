# Aggressive Murja 
<sup><sub>(as in "aggressiivinen viinimurjapaska)</sub></sup>

I'm rewriting my trusty old [murja-blog](https://github.com/feuery/murja-blog) in lisp. In the first phase I'm touching the frontend as little as possible, and when I can retire the old clojure-server, I will probably break compability with the old backend and develop new features.
